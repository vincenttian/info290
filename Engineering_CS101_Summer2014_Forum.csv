It's always a treat for me when I go to the forums to address a question, but find that other students have already provided great answers.

Here's the standard advice for forums:

(1) Search before you post - someone might have already posted an answer to your question, and it will be easier for everyone if there aren't a lot of duplicate postings.

(2) Use the sub-forums, e.g. discuss exercise questions (without posting solutions!) in the \"Exercises\" forum.

(3) Let’s follow the golden rule in all posts – write to others as you would like them to write to you. We try to interpret each other charitably, treat each other with respect, and be civil and professional in all our posts.

Looking forward to a nice summer course with you all!

There are lectures and exercises every week for 6 weeks. Instead of a separate deadline each week, we have one big deadline at the end of the course -- August 28, 2014. All exercises must be completed by August 28th. This provides flexibility for people starting late, or missing a week to go on vacation. That said, it is best to work on each week's exercises when assigned, since that's what we'll be talking about on the forums that week, rather than letting unfinished exercises pile up

A net 80% or better score across the exercises is required successfully complete the course. People successfully completing the course will receive a Stanford statement of accomplishment.\"

A little bit about myself. I live in California and am a Junior at UC Davis. I'm majoring in Managerial Economics and would like to work at a technology company coming out of college. I was thinking about going in to Finance but I still haven't pinpointed exactly what I want to do. I thought since my goal is to work at a Technology company, I should have somewhat of a Technical background. Hopefully this course will serve as that for me. 

What about all of you? What's the age range of all of you and what are you studying in school/doing at work etc.?

Love to hear from all of you!

It is a pleasure to meet you. I was born and raised in Santa Rosa, which is about an hour to the west of UC Davis. I am currently serving in a senior HR capacity at a federal agency, after having served in the US Navy (Electronics Engineering) and US Department of Justice (HR). I possess a BS in Business Administration, a MS in Human Resources and a year of law school education. I was recently accepted to the University of Washington's Technology Management MBA program, and much like you, plan to eventually work within the technology sector. While I do not intend to serve in a strictly IT or engineering capacity, these courses will provide a validation of my current CS knowledge and additional foundation that should prove helpful in future endeavors. I would really enjoy hearing from others as well!

I am very excited about this course! I went to Arizona State University for and received my bachelors degree in something completely unrelated to computer science. I recently gained an interest in programming so I'm currently using internet resources to try and get up to speed on key computer science concepts as well as a few languages.

I think it is awesome that you are making this class available to online students for free. Do you also offer any other free computer science classes to online students?

Thank you,

Nice to meet both of you.

I've lived in Arizona for most of my life. I went to Arizona State University and received a Bachelors in justice studies as well as a minor in BioChemistry. My plan was to become a lawyer but I shifted gears recently. 

I'm currently 26 years old and I work for a small online software company as a support rep. I'm trying to move up in my company and become one of the software developers.

I've been studying html, css and javascript for a couple months now on my own. However, I am really excited about this course because I am sure there are a lot of basic computer science concepts that I missed in my self-study. I hope to strengthen  my basic understanding on computer science concepts.

Certainly on the page in html format there is, I assume, what you are referring to.  However, for those of us who have limited internet bandwidth and uptime, the ability to access this info offline would be a help.  Currently I am saving the html page, but obviously there is a great deal of overhead to that.  Is the information in a document format (pdf, docx, etc) and if so, where can it be found?  Since I am accessing this course from Myanmar at extremely degraded internet speeds (think slightly better than dialup) any streamlining would be appreciated.

?Learn to Program the Fundamentals: An intro level programming course that is a great intro to programming in Python.

?Learn to Program Crafting Quality Code: The second part of the above course. Teaches better programming technics using Python. After taking the two above courses, you will have a good foundation to take the next course.

?Intro to Interactive Programming in Python: It is an intro class and you COULD take it as a first programming class, but it takes off fast and many students without previous programming experience struggle. In this class you learn to program by building video games!

?CS50X Intro to Computer Science: This is the exact CS freshman at Harvard take. It is the same lectures, recorded from the lecture hall. Same assignments. This class will introduce you to a few other programming languages.

?CS6.001 Intro to Computer Science and Programming: This is a difficult class. Again, you COULD take it without taking the above classes, but it will be very tough. The class has a high dropout rate by those with little or no programming knowledge. This class also uses Python. You will solve computational problems by via programming. 

You can skip around the list if you like. These are just classes I have taken and enjoyed.

Right now I'm taking a more intermediate CS programming course named Principles of Computing offered by Rice University. BUT you do NOT want to take that course until you are confident programming code that is 100 lines or more and have taken Intro to Interactive Programming in Python (as suggested by the professors). After that I will be taking the final course they offer named Algorithmic Thinking.","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-07-16 14:41:06","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53c59b647c640c6f0500009a","53c5b987d02871f4f5000091","[ObjectId('53c5b987d02871f4f5000091')]","53c5b987d02871f4f5000091-53c68f022c1108d2a500006e","",""

I have always been into language and arts and left the math and science to my brothers. Then while trying to start up an art-based online business, I had some bad experiences with developers who charged a lot for their services but delivered a poorly functioning website. 

I decided that I need to learn more about the technical side myself. Took a few courses on Codecademy and was surprised to find out that learning code is a lot like learning a language!

Pretty excited to be part of CS101.
I am transitioning my career from the Health Care Industry to Tech StartUps [I have a Medical Degree (MD)] 
This Class seems like the perfect foundation course I needed.
I only wish there was a way to get access to all lectures / assignments and not have to wait a week :)
<br>
I understand that weekly lectures set the mood for a live & progressive course.
<br>
But nonetheless this is simply awesome :)

Looking forward to next week's class.

Also I'd be more than happy to help any students who need help with any problem set / assignment / lecture or any other questions in general.

I have taken and recommend taking in this order the following free MOOCs.

 1. This class
 2. Learn to Program the Fundamentals (a MOOC on Coursera by    the U of
   Toronto)
 3. Learn to Program Crafting Quality Code (second part of the above)
 4. Intro to Interactive Programming in Python (gaming CS programming
   course offered by Rice University on Coursera)
 5. CS50X Intro to Computer Science (The main intro CS class at Harvard
   University offered on edX)
 6. CS6.001 Intro to Computer Science and Programming (This class is hard
   but well worth it. It is offered by MIT on edX)

I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Melbourne, Australia. I've been programming for about 3 to 4 years now (mostly web development with Ruby, JavaScript etc), and am currently finishing the final 3 months of high school. Despite the fact that I knew I'd be busy preparing for end of year exams, when I first saw a notice about this course I knew I had to do it.

I look forward to meeting the rest of you on here over the next 6 weeks. May there be many intelligent discussions to come :)

I realise that its probably a bit late to fix now, but I find that when you are talking in the videos, you tend to drop your voice toward the end of the sentence so that I lose what you are saying. Also, you speak quite quickly.

This probably bothers me more than most, since I have a hearing deficit, so I may be in the minority of participants. 

The situation is saved somewhat by the transcription on the right, but I am trying to watch what you do and read the transcription and lip-read all at the same time, so I am often rewinding. This disturbs the flow somewhat.

After that rant, I'm not really sure what can be done, but at least I've expressed point of view!","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-07-17 07:40:21","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53c3152255ffd70fdd000019","None","[]","53c77de53b4c1c34e6000005","",""

> How is the code retrieving the image? 

You're absolutely right in asking yourself where the image is actually coming from. For the purposes of the lesson, we just need to assume that it's in our current directory - but in a real life scenario you would have something more specific like `(\"images/x.png\")`. Good pick up.

> I am not able to make the pixel go orange, I am getting an error message saying Pixel not defined.

Changing the pixel color to orange won't cause that error message. Think about what the Error message is telling you: \"Pixel not defined\". There could be 2 causes for this failure:

 1. The coordinates you passed to `getPixel()` do not exist. Eg - (2000, 3750).
 2. You didn't pass the `setRed()` and `setGreen()` functions to the `pixel` variable that you set earlier. This means that your telling these functions to set a color for a pixel for nothing - and how can you set the color of nothing?

This worked for me...

    ...
    pixel = image.getPixel(0, 0);
    pixel.setRed(255);
    pixel.setGreen(170);

Good luck,

They tell JavaScript that the line of code has ended, and it's time to execute a new *instruction*. While some of you have figured out that their absence will not \"break\" your code, it is only because JavaScript automatically adds them for you when the code is run.

Programmers use conventions called semantics, examples including the use of semicolons and using spaces between function arguments: `print(\"I\", \"use\", \"semantics.\");`. In computer programming, semantics...

- Improve code readability.
- Make updating code much easier.
- Allow other people to interact with your code.

These ranges apply to 8-bit color depth but please note that there are higher color depths (10, 16) that have higher values but similar in range.

RGB do not traditionally have the same ‘black’ and ‘white’ levels.In 8-bit RGB black is ‘0’, and 8-bit RGB white is ‘255’. 

Many applications (like Final Cut Pro, Premiere Pro, After Effects) will convert YUV to RGB in such a way that expands and maps the black/white levels of YUV to the black/white levels of RGB, and likewise they will convert RGB to YUV in such a way that contracts and maps the black/white levels of RGB to the black/white levels of YUV. This is considered converting YUV to Full Range RGB (or Computer Range RGB) because the 16-235 values of YUV are expanded and mapped to the Full Range 0-255 of RGB.","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-07-17 19:23:50","{u'count': 2, u'point': 2, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [u'506948', u'452993'], u'down': [], u'up_count': 2}",2,0,2,"['506948', '452993']","[]","53c69023a9c73cca81000036","None","[]","53c822c63fc3d2d5b0000062","",""

    You ask, 'Why not 0-10 or 0-100 or -100 to +100?'

    #ff or #FF or 0xFF is hexadecimal or base 16 notation, and #ff is the same as 255 in decimal or base 10. Hexadecimal (base 16) converts to binary (base 2) easily, as 16 == 2^4.
            
    However, the w3 specification for CSS2 (Cascading Style Sheets) states:
    A <color> is either a keyword or a numerical RGB specification.
    The RGB color model is used in numerical color specifications. These examples all specify the same color:
    EM { color: #f00 }              /* #rgb */
    EM { color: #ff0000 }           /* #rrggbb */
    EM { color: rgb(255,0,0) }      /* integer range 0 - 255 */
    EM { color: rgb(100%, 0%, 0%) } /* float range 0.0% - 100.0% */

-The submit button sends your answer back to the stanford-online server for grading. If that fails once, it could be some intermittent issue on our end, and hopefully submitting again will work. If we're seeing this a lot, it suggests some real issue at stanford-online which we'll need to track down and fix. If seeing problems, consider not using IE. Firefox and Chrome have the best reputations for quality (and CS101 is kind of complicated as browser-html goes).

-I agree the little list-looking thing at the top with the arrows is useless. It never does anything in CS101, but some other courses use it. It's just there as part of the standard open-edx platform.

-Each code writing exercise should show the code-text area and a run button. If the Run button is missing, the page must not have loaded fully (like maybe the network had a problem, and the page only partially got through). Try loading the page again.","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-07-18 18:13:56","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53c5122dd02871570a000014","None","[]","53c963e47516b999d9000022","",""

The week-2 stuff definitely boosts the difficulty, but the output gets a lot more entertaining too.

We're experimenting with soft-releasing material a little early -- i.e. we put the pages up, but we haven't sent email about it. So week-2 is available now actually, if you want to get an early start.

  // Doubles the pixel's red value


  old = pixel.getRed();


  pixel.setRed(old * 2);

But then we are informed that....

old = pixel.getRed();

Is not necessary and that the code can can be combined and rewritten into:

pixel.setRed(pixel.getRed() * 2);

The next part indicates:

Suppose we have a pixel r:50 g:20 b:30

Q: What does running the line above do to the pixel?

1. Evaluates the pixel.getRed() * 2 expression (100)

2. Then calls pixel.setRed(100);

Result is changing the pixel to r:100 g:20 b:30

Whatever the red value, the line doubles it

Okay suppose I follow that logic but...I am lost here...

Suppose we have a pixel r:50 g:20 b:30


That is fine but how has this information been stored and given a value?

When ....

old = pixel.getRed(); 

was entered..

The code made sense as we have allocated a variable to be stored in a part of the computers memory and given that variable the name 'old'. 

So, in turn, we then allocate a value to this variable named 'old' and whenever we want to change the value of the variable we instruct the computer to do this by invoking the code:

pixel.setRed(old * 2);

But if we are using the one line:


pixel.setRed(pixel.getRed() * 2);


How does this retrieve the variable via the getRed instruction especially If we have not yet created such a variable?

I agree writing one line is much easier and quicker to do if I understand why I am doing this but I don't understand how it can work as we have not instructed the computer to store a variable let alone stored a value to that variable?

How? can this be if a variable has not yet been stored into the memory of a computer and given a name ...where the value can be stored?

How does the computer know to retrieve the variable via the getRed() instruction if we have not written the variable in the first place and...on top of that where can the computer retrieve a value if we have not written up and stored a variable let alone a value?

Up to this point it made sense but now I am confused.","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-07-19 15:04:26","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","None","None","None","None","",""

Thank you for starting this topic Haaris! 

I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and I live near the center of the continental USA. I'm 36 years old and have been a veterinary technician (nurse) for more or less 13 years. I also have a bachelor's degree in management and ethics. Currently I work at a veterinary teaching school where I take care of patients and help teach veterinary students. I like my job a lot, but it's not very well compensated. 

I decided to learn how to build websites and to prevent adding to my family's debt I'm teaching myself html out of a book (with plans to move on to CSS and JavaScript and then probably PHP and we'll see what else). Since I'm not doing a formal course of study I want to make sure I have a solid foundation so when I saw this course I had to try it. So far I'm having a lot of fun! 

Someday I hope I can build websites for small animal-related businesses, especially veterinary offices. I see this as an extension of what I do now, helping my students succeed once they get out into the real world of business by helping create and maintain an open line of communication between veterinarians and their clients. Whether this will just be a sideline to help pay the bills or something more remains to be seen. But I'm determined that if I do it, I'm going to do it right. I think this course will help with that. 

I'm excited to meet you all!","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-07-19 16:34:21","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53c5e7bad0287154860000b1","None","[]","53ca9e0d1e43f391bc00000c","",""

When we have an '=' sign, we are taking a value and storing it in a container with whatever name we want. With pixel.getRed() though, we aren't using variables. Whenever you see '()' you're looking at a function which acts a bit differently.<br>
`pixel.setRed(pixel.getRed()*2)`<br>
In this example, we are calling on two different functions, pixel.setRed and pixel.getRed. Whatever is on the inside of the '()' are what we call parameters, which are the numbers we want to use for our function. To give an example:<br><br>

    add(x,y){ result = x+y; print (result); }

That is a basic function called add which takes two parameters(numbers) and simply adds them together. The sum is stored in a variable called 'result' and then we use another function called print that takes one parameter, in this case our result, and prints it to the screen. <br><br>
So for pixel.setRed(pixel.getRed()*2) when we use the function pixel.setRed it looks in the brackets to see what number we want to run the function with. It sees pixel.getRed() * 2, so it needs to run the function to get a value to multiply by two. 
<br> A similar thing happened with old = pixel.getRed(). When the computer saw old * 2 as our parameter, it had to go find what old equaled, then multiplied by two to get a number. <br><br>
I hope that makes a bit of sense","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-07-19 16:38:21","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53ca88fa1e43f3a3da00001a","None","[]","53ca9efd1e43f3a3da00001d","",""

Thanks so much it's was getting on my nerves doing a task and not understanding how and why the code could get it to work in this way.  

So functions are something already pre-set and we can ask the computer to do something with this function when we write code instructing the computer to do something/change something.

I was so glad when I found this course because computer logic and code writing is one area which I have really never understood!
One week into this course and I am already feeling very confident about myself!

The red and the blue values can be left out of the code completely since they don't need to be changed. So the for loop will look like this:

for (pixel: image) {

pixel.setGreen(0);

}

because it is changing every green value to 0 (black).

Make sure you have every character of the code correct. Leaving out the semi-colon on the line \"pixel.setGreen(0);\" will cause the flowers to stay yellow.

The image in the second question should be a flat red image with no flowers showing. In this case, you are setting the blue and green values to 0 (black) and the red value to 255. So, there will be three lines of code in the for loop:

for (pixel: image) {

  pixel.setRed(255);

  pixel.setGreen(0);

  pixel.setBlue(0);

 }

Let me know if you have any other questions.","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-07-21 20:20:43","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53cd66879ba59ec3f8000026","None","[]","53cd761b9ba59ec45d000033","",""

You will need to use that code by setting red, green and blue but making sure you are changing the multiplication value on each line of code to either 5, 10 or 20 until you get the correct answer.
Trying to imagine how the output image will look like will help you to know where to put more red,  more green or more blue. It's a puzzle, so you interchange those numbers until you get the right one.

When you move everything after the curly open bracket down a line, the code works.I also found that if the curly brace is not in the same line as the loop statement, the doesn't work again!

This may be because of the following reason(but i am not sure of it!):
As we know, the for loop does not exist in java and it has been added into this program.
Since it has been added externally, the loop works based on how it is defined in the program. If it has been defined such that it would give the output only if the curly brace is in the same line as the loop statement, then it wouldn't give the output in any other format.

If you have learnt the C language you would see the difference. In C, the for loop is defined i.e. it is present in the language...So,it works perfectly well(in any format!)!

This may be one of the reasons...I hope it helped you!!","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-07-22 07:43:02","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53cdbfd39ba59ec3f8000041","None","[]","53ce1606caaf0e92bc000018","",""

It doesn't work the same way as in this course, but I'd bet a lot of things don't work.  What we get in this course seems to be a blend of different languages just to give a taste of how to do things but without being specific instructions in how to do them.

To do a for loop properly in \"real\" javascript, you write something like this:

    for(i=0;i<10;i++){
     // do something
    }

What this does is create a variable called \"i\" and sets the initial value to 0.  Then it says keep looping until i=10 (so we want to do this 10 times), and finally the i++ command is saying \"increment i by 1\" (and you could also write it as i=i+1, the other way is just faster).  You don't put a semicolon after the increment part, and it doesn't have to increment, you could even multiply (i=i*2) but you would not normally.

Loops are fun but there is a hidden danger that you could write a loop that repeats forever if you don't write it correctly, and that could produce really bad results under some conditions.

For example if you wrote it as (i=0;i<10;i--) or (i=0;i<10;i=i) then the loop would never end because i could never reach 10 unless some other code inside the loop changed its value.","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-07-22 19:34:33","{u'count': 1, u'point': 1, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [u'501993'], u'down': [], u'up_count': 1}",1,0,1,"['501993']","[]","53cd91ee68565ac5ec00002a","None","[]","53cebcc9caaf0e50bd00002d","",""

yellow = Green + Red , so if we set the Green to 0 the Red only remains , you don't have to set the Blue to 0 and the Red to 255 that will turn it into a red square because all the pixels are 255 red .

You decide to shrink the 'image' to 1/3 its previous length. (for simplicity sake we are only dealing with a one dimensional problem instead of two.)
Each three numbers must be made into one. So it's logical to take the average of each. In this case it means just taking the middle of each group of three.
2,5,8, 11, 13.
Assuming you've lost the original but want your 'image' back to full size, you must multiply each by 3 but you've lost the original data so the only thing you can do is:

ASCII has  256 but that's due to the same reason why there are 256 choices for RGB values. It has to do with binary code and the values you can make using the length of the numbers we can work with. The range written in binary is <zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac> to <zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac>. Each <zipRedac> represents a power of two.. think of it like 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 ..... + 2^<zipRedac>. If the value is one, you include that power, is it's zero you don't.
<br> If you were to ad all of them up, you'd get 256 values ranging from <zipRedac> to 255.  This systems is also used for ASCII characters which is why it also has 256, but these aren't used to make colours, rather they represent letters and characters.","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-07-22 22:03:40","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53cde276caaf0e92bc00000e","53cdf56c68565a98a0000052","[ObjectId('53cdf56c68565a98a0000052')]","53cdf56c68565a98a0000052-53cedfbc7aedc4fc10000048","",""

Your code sets the blue value for every pixel at 10. This would result in a solid blue square.

There is an image in the blue values. Some pixels are lighter and some are darker. The problem said the original blue values were divided by 10, which would make everything darker.

In order to get the original image, you need to write the setBlue line so that each pixel's blue value is multiplied by 10.","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-07-23 21:46:38","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53cff67ddb6bf3c2b900001a","None","[]","53d02d3edb6bf3a4ca000029","",""

From what I understand, new lessons are released on Tuesdays (or have been so far). Assuming you recieve course emails, you'll get an email notifying you when each weeks lesson is posted. I haven't got the fainest idea if it gets posted the same time each Tuesday but this is a MOOC...it's not as if we've got a classroom slot we need to stick to.

Do you mean the above post in this discussion thread? - \"two days ago\" means two days ago...from today. Annonymous posted, and gbmahili responded, two days ago. I'm not sure if you really need anything more specific as far as time and date goes for that. The conversation in the discussion boards is meant to be quite fluid with quick responses.

looking at your screenshot I can see that you uncommented the line pixel.setRed(255). JavaScript sees the two forward slashes ( // ) and interprets this as a sign to jump to the next line. Removing // should solve your problem.
Also, I am not sure whether this is necessary, but try to end each line with a semi-colon. They are there in some lines but not in your for-loop. 
Hope this helps,

I am not quiet sure, but I think there's a small typo in week 3's course material (*Image Logic*). The source code says:

> if (pixel.getRed() > **160**)

But the explanation below says:

> For each pixel, the if-statement above retrieves the red value, and tests if the value is greater than **180**. 

I think it should either both be 160 or 180, just to prevent people of getting confused.

For this question: Write code that picks out the pixels of the green leaves in the image (using the > avg * factor technique, as in lecture). For each green pixel identified, set its green value to 0. The result is that the green leaves are changed to a sort of weird purple color, since setting green to 0, we just have red and blue contributing.

I am wondering if there is any average factor in particular we should use or if we just make that decision by ourselfs to get the points complete in this question. I am attaching the picture I just got with the code I wrote, all the green leaves look purple. I used an average factor of 1.0 or just simple the average.

We're allowed to put whatever we want to inside of the () for parameters, as long as the right number of them appear(we can't put two numbers when it only wants one for example). This means we can use a function if we don't know the value(like the actual number for the RGB values at each pixel).<BR><BR>
If, for example, we wanted to increase the red in a picture by 50 over each pixel, we could input pixel.getRed() + 50 as our parameter and this would find the red value, then add 50 to it. <br>
In Q3, we want factors so we need to multiply or divide instead of add in this case. Half the average is the same as average/2 and 1.2 times the average is the same as average * 1.2.<br><br>

Worked like a charm!  Basically, if the Red in a pixel was originally 1, it would now be 254, where if it was say, 254, it would now be 1.  So no matter what value the color of eahc pixel has, it would get a perfect reversal!

The way you wrote it, with the formula to get the average inside the instructions for each pixel, I think the computer averages that particular pixel's RGB amounts and then applies that number to the Red, Green, and Blue values of that pixel.  So in that case not every pixel would have the same RGB values, because each pixel's average would be different.

I have noticed quite a few questions in the discussion area that make it difficult to respond. Here are some suggestions:

1. Be specific in your title. For example, \"I need help\" is not helpful to those that could offer you help. Please say something more specific, for example, \"How do you load the background picture?\"

A few things to note though, the if statements could be simplified a bit as well as your code wouldn't handle certain colours, like purple, as you'd want them. Contrasting the colours vs. the average is probably safer than using the and comparisons. <br>
You could also try using else if to handle the white parts:<br>
if (pixel.getRed() > avg)  // to select red pixels <br>

Yes. I did try it with \"avg\" variable and also a range of multipliers with avg. 
As you can see in the code that i did calculate the avg, but haven't used it anywhere, as i wasn't really getting the desired results. It was quite a HIT and TRY thing. Thus, instead, i chose to go for approximations(which got me very close).

Secondly, i agree that \"else if\" may be used to handle white parts. I deliberately didn't try to make them disappear, as i wanted to have fine/distinct boundaries between the concentric circles.

What you have posted is exactly the opposite. The computer indeed needs to calculate avg for each pixel separately. 

Lets just see the difference in code:

Case 1: avg is OUTSIDE for loop. This is what your response implies. that avg is calculated only once.

    avg = (pixel.getRed() + pixel.getGreen() + pixel.getBlue())/3
    for(pixel:image)
    { //Code here }

Case 2: avg is inside for loop. This is what actually should happen i.e. avg needs to be calculated individually.
    for(pixel:image)
    { avg = (pixel.getRed() + pixel.getGreen() + pixel.getBlue())/3
     
    }


----------


WHY???

Because if you apply the same avg to all pixels, you will get a complete grey picture rather than a grayscale picture.

Firstly, just write the code as follows & see if it works.
It will **definitely WORK!**

      image = new SimpleImage(\"poppy.jpg\");
      for (pixel: image) 
      {
       avg = (pixel.getRed() + pixel.getGreen() + pixel.getBlue())/3;
       pixel.setRed(avg);
       pixel.setGreen(avg);
       pixel.setBlue(avg);
      } 
      print(image);
 
**REASON:**

Although your code looks exactly the same. Yet it works differently because it is NOT at all the same. Here is a very tiny catch! **\"A computer(in this case an interpreter) executes the statements within a block, line-be-line\"**


----------


Lets denote your code by Case 1 & my code by Case 2.

In Case 2, once inside the loop, for any given pixel, the computer will calculate the avg value(for that particular pixel) only **ONCE** & then pass it as an argument to pixel.SetRed(), pixel.SetGreen() & pixel.setBlue(). 

Lets suppose the RGB values are R=100, G=120, B=140 for that particular pixel. Therefore, **avg = 360/3 = 120**. Thus,
the statements are executed in the following order:

    pixel.SetRed(120) 
    pixel.SetGreen(120)
    pixel.setBlue(120)


----------


While, in Case 1, once inside the loop, the compiler will do the following things for the same pixel as in case 2(i.e. R=100, G=120, B=140) in the order as follows:

 **1.** Set the red value of the pixel to the avg of RGB of that pixel [i.e. **avg** = (100+120+140)/3 = **120**]. Remember, now R = 120 and not 100.
 
**2.** Set the green value of the pixel to the avg value of RGB which will now be changed, as **avg** = (R+G+B)/3 = (120+120+140)/3 = 380/3 = **126.66**

**3.** Set the blue value of that pixel to the avg value of RGB, which will again be different, as **avg** = (R+G+B)/3 = (120+126.6+140)/3 = 386.6/3 = **128.86**

**Clearly, 120 (NOT =) 126.6 (NOT =) 128.6.** 
Hence, a perfect Grayscale shall never be obtained.

**In nutshell, in case 2, the value of avg remains constant but in case 1(your code) the value of avg. is changed 2 times, thus resulting in 3 different values.**","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-07-28 03:33:19","{u'count': 3, u'point': 3, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [u'524918', u'442197', u'475717'], u'down': [], u'up_count': 3}",3,0,3,"['524918', '442197', '475717']","[]","53d57eae13c1df54c9000037","None","[]","53d5c47f81ef0a42b3000003","",""

Complexity will depend on the image, how many hues required to produce the colour image, relative contrast between pixels etc...  It could be done although I think even in most photo editors it could be quite painful to get a good result.

If brightness of the pixel indicates the necessary hue you could use code somthing like this, (tested on the banana.jpg):

    for (pixel: image) {
    avg = (pixel.getRed() + pixel.getGreen() + pixel.getBlue())/3
    if(avg>150) {
      pixel.setRed(avg*3*0.5)
      pixel.setGreen(avg*3*0.5)
      pixel.setBlue(avg*3*0)
    }
    if(avg<140) {
      pixel.setRed(avg*3*0.6)
      pixel.setGreen(avg*3*0.15)
      pixel.setBlue(avg*3*0.25)
    }
    }
    print(image);
    
The idea is to maintain the brightness but alter the hue.
*avg*3*colour ratio* is used to make it easier to understand and play with the values.

The test is not refined but I am quite happy with the means to set the colour.
I'm afraid my coding experience to date consists of Excel formulas (reasonably regular use) and ZX Spectrum basic (forgotten for 30 years).
Is someone able to tell us how to determine if a value is between 2 values (eg. >100 and <150)?  Also how to set tests with more than one criteria (eg. if brightness  is x and pixel position is y)?

Thinking about the problem I see 3 main possibilities for a test to select pixels of a grayscale image:  Brightness, position and other pixels.

Combining brightness and position would give quite a powerful test to select areas for colouring.
In some instances other pixels might help to define objects for colouring.
The banana.jpg has a strong black shadow that defines the lower edge of the banana.  Theoretically then it may be possible to code so that pixels between the bright top edge and black shadow on the lower edge have a yellow hue.

It may be best to have different stages of processing.
For a grayscale banana.jpg, if you could find the banana and change it's hue to yellow, it would be relatively trivial to then determine the remaining pixels as grayscale and use brightness to determine between bricks and mortar.
 
Anyone with some different ideas?","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-07-28 15:03:13","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53d60cdf81ef0a42b300000d","None","[]","53d6663181ef0ab134000013","",""

So I guess to answer your question, find an image editor and do it yourself, or go pixel by pixel and estimate the right colour based on how you think it should look(not really something you would want to do).","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-07-28 15:04:47","{u'count': 1, u'point': 1, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [u'442197'], u'down': [], u'up_count': 1}",1,0,1,"['442197']","[]","53d60cdf81ef0a42b300000d","None","[]","53d6668f5c375d41d4000016","",""

What you could do is for each pixel, write the x and y values to an array, but you'd still need some sort of filter if you wanted to use a for loop to do the selecting for you.

That gives the means to use multiple tests to choose pixels for alteration.  For instance choosing a part of the screen and testing the brightness of the pixels then altering the hue.

    image = new SimpleImage(\"banana.jpg\");
    
    print(image.getWidth(),image.getHeight()); //show dims as guide
    
    for(pixel: image) {
    avg=(pixel.getRed()+pixel.getGreen()+pixel.getBlue())/3;
    if (pixel.getX()<=110 && avg>95) {
    
    pixel.setRed(avg*3*0.45);
    pixel.setGreen(avg*3*0.3);
    pixel.setBlue(avg*3*0.25);
     }
    }
    print(image);

It's possible to get a decent effect, very much like tinting or hand-colouring  black and white film.  A lot of trial and error is necessary but for a simple image there are less steps than you may think.

Exact areas of the image can be chosen by using && with pixel co-ordinates.

    `if (pixel.getX()>=110 && pixel.getX()<=705 && pixel.getY()>=165 && pixel.getY()<=350)`

From experimenting my advice would be use a for loop with if statement and print image as we have been shown, start with grayscale.  Then code another loop immediately beneath and print image.  You can then see progression as you make alterations.

You are quite likely to discover parameters as you progress that allow you to simplify code, to use less loops.
OR logic, maybe you know how, would also make the code more efficient.

It's quite surprising how little code is necessary to affect most of the banana.jpg image.  When I have more time I'll paste my best effort.

To be honest with you I wouldn't want to go through the pain of trying to achieve this in an image editor (unless there was a very good reason) but I'm learning a lot from playing around.","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-07-29 16:35:29","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53d60cdf81ef0a42b300000d","53d6663181ef0ab134000013","[ObjectId('53d6663181ef0ab134000013')]","53d6663181ef0ab134000013-53d7cd51e62492b8ab00002d","",""

Here's my BlueScreen Image **Output using Multiple(6) images**.
I had thought of trying it over the Microsoft logo. But then decided to stick to chrome, as i thought **Chrome-logo** would be more tricky. 
After hell lot of complex permutations and combinations, finally got it right. It is not perfect, but it is very close.
Here's the Final Image:

Finding the shady side of the banana which is a similar brightness to the bricks was a little tricky.

The idea of the \"//find rest of banana\" code is to select pixels according to the rough position of the banana, then to test if a pixel positioned 10 pixels above is probably yellow (top half of the banana already altered) and that the shadow has not been reached yet, for this I used 3 pixels below.
I started out at 1 pixel above and below but some areas of brick and moss are quite bright so get changed to yellow with the top half of the banana.  Looking at pixels a few away prevents too much change away from the banana.

I've left the print(image) code at every stage in case anyone wants to run it and see what each part of the code achieves.

Or is the idea to actually approximate reconstructing the original colors to create a somewhat realistic image? 

The latter really isn't possible without a good bit of user input. There are nearly 16.8 million colors possible with 8-bit RGB (256 * 256 * 256). Those colors are represented in grayscale by just 256 different shades of gray, from (0,0,0) to (255,255,255). In other words, on average, any given shade of pure gray could represent one of more than 65,000 different RGB colors. 

Even granting that the difference between some of those colors is imperceptible, it's safe to say that the possibilities for any single shade of gray are pretty broad – and there's no simple script that's going to be able to guess whether an (85,85,85) gray pixel should remain gray, be the brightest pure shade of red, green, or blue, or be assigned one of the thousands of hues in between.

With some user input and knowledge of what the colors should be, it might be possible to effectively script bulk changes to colorize an evenly lit grayscale picture that (in its colorized form) contains relatively few colors. But it would still take a lot of manual tweaking to achieve any kind of realism -- and you'd have to work out a whole new set of parameters for every new image that you were colorizing.

It might be fun to try for some simple images, but for any practical application…I think that the amount of user input required would defeat the purpose of trying to automate the process.","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-07-30 04:42:52","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53d60cdf81ef0a42b300000d","None","[]","53d877cc7c113c543200006a","",""

This is the code used to cage the lion:

image = new SimpleImage(\"bars.jpg\");
back = new SimpleImage(\"lion.jpg\");
back.setSameSize(image);

for (pixel: image) {
  avg = (pixel.getRed() + pixel.getGreen() + pixel.getBlue())/3;
  if (pixel.getRed()>=200){
  
  x = pixel.getX();
    y = pixel.getY();
    pixel2 = back.getPixel(x, y);
    pixel.setRed(pixel2.getRed());
    pixel.setGreen(pixel2.getGreen());
    pixel.setBlue(pixel2.getBlue());
  
  }
  
}
print(image);

I had a problem creating the bars.  I wrote the code to create the first bar.  I had to copy it ten times to get the ten-bar cage.  I tried to use a \"for\" command based on the fact that the only difference between each bar and the next one to its right,  is that x=x+<zipRedac>0.

Here is the code I used:

image = new SimpleImage(\"blank.jpg\");

//Drawing first bar

//for#1-Definition of A
for (pixel: image) {
  //if#1-Definition of A
if(pixel.getX()==1){
A=pixel.getX()

}
//endfor#1
}

//for#2
for(pixel:image){


//if#2-Left side of bar
//if#3-Right side of bar
if(pixel.getX()<=A+10){
if(pixel.getX()>=A){
  pixel.setRed(20);
  pixel.setBlue(20);
  pixel.setGreen(20)
  
//endif#3
}
//endif#2
}
//endfor#2
}
//End of drawing first bar

//Drawing second bar

  pixel.setBlue(20);

The analogy of hand colouring black and white film stands.  The closer to reality desired the longer it will take.  Hand colouring an entire movie would not have been practical without a lot of resource but it has been done.

User input is of course required to determine hue, but relative brightness can be maintained, so if I am right hue has only <zipRedac>1845 possibilities, 16.7m/(possibilities for pixel brightness <zipRedac>56+<zipRedac>56+<zipRedac>56).  Still a lot, but break that down with even a basic knowledge of how red, green and blue mix together and we start to get into manageable territory.

If you have another image file with colours you require you can get close to the desired hues (ratio of red, blue and green) by selecting areas with the loop and if statement determining position and then using: `pixel.getRed();pixel.getGreen();pixel.getBlue();`

What I'm taking from this excercise is that identifying the test and how you wish to alter pixels is the main challenge, not writing the actual code.  With enough time the task could probably be achieved with only the code learnt so far.
With knowledge of how to produce a random integer you could even script to make micro-adjustments to hues, pixel by pixel to give a less artificial look.

I'm really happy with this course, it is doing what I hoped in giving me better insight into how computers work.  I now see how the magic of face-detection, red-eye reduction etc. is possible and why their function and speed has improved over time.","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-07-30 11:15:43","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53d60cdf81ef0a42b300000d","53d877cc7c113c543200006a","[ObjectId('53d877cc7c113c543200006a')]","53d877cc7c113c543200006a-53d8d3dfbf614b344b00000f","",""

If I replace the word \"cat.jpg\" to use one of the course images, the code runs perfectly. 

e.g. image = new SimpleImage (\"cat.jpg\");    \\does not work, but
     image = new SimpleImage (\"monkey.jpg\");   \\works fine with the following code.

Beyond that, you're right, my bringing \"practicality\" into it was beside the point. Even for some of the simpler image manipulations that we've done, there are obviously quicker and more elegant solutions than hand-coding. And, as a tangential benefit, I feel like I have a better sense of how to effectively use those more elegant solutions now that we've spent some time looking at it from the computer's point of view.

Back to the problem at hand, though: The biggest trick, I think, is in defining irregularly shaped pixel regions. In most pictures, there are going to be areas of light and shadow determined by the direction of the light source(s). And it may be that adjacent pixels of different hues are closer in \"total brightness\" than the pixels of similar hue in highlight and shadow regions. So a global command to give all pixels within a given range of grayscale values a similar tint won't work. 

Selecting a pixel, setting its RGB value, and assigning a similar ratio of R, G & B to all pixels within a given (x,y) range will let you make your whole banana yellow while maintaining areas of relative light and shadow. But it only works if the given range is \"banana\". If the range is all pixels within (x +/- var, y +/- var) of your key pixel, then you can colorize whole squares at a time. But bananas, and most other objects, aren't squares. You would have to repeat the process hundreds or thousands (or hundreds of thousands) of times, with squares of varying size, and probably unnecessary repetition of calculations, to maintain the integrity of the picture.

If you can figure out how to make the computer identify borders of objects (or how to create a selection tool), then you're onto something. But you're onto something that's way over my head!","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-07-30 19:56:48","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53d60cdf81ef0a42b300000d","53d877cc7c113c543200006a","[ObjectId('53d877cc7c113c543200006a')]","53d877cc7c113c543200006a-53d94e00bf614b344b00002e","",""

I'd have liked it if I could have made the leopard print shaded in the same way his blue clothes were, but i don't know how ot do that.
It also might have been funny to make the bird feet blue as well, but unfortunately the sky turned leopard print before the bird feet did, so I had to give it up.

This code works by isolating the curb pixels; they have a higher red value than average. So, you should set up your if statement by selecting the pixels that have relatively high red values.

Set these pixels at the values the question states. Lower the red and green values to half of the average (avg * 0.5) and raise the blue values to 1.2 of the average (avg * 1.2).

Hope this helps.","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-07-31 08:31:19","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53d9f49114fe220892000003","None","[]","53d9fed714fe220892000005","",""

In fact, you can replace \"pixel\" with any other string and it keeps working well.

    image = new SimpleImage(\"flowers.jpg\");
    
    for (pixy: image) {
      pixy.setRed(0);
      pixy.setGreen(0);
      pixy.setBlue(0);
    }
    
    print(image);

Don't know if 'variable' here applied to pixel is the correct term :)

Maybe it is more clear with a for-loop with a list of numbers.

    for(i=0; i<10; i++) { 
      // here you can use the variable i

That's what my guess was. I said: 

> My guess is that there is only one component of an image--i.e. a pixel-- so the for-each loop establishes \"pixel\" as the reference.

But here's where I'm a little confused: It looks as though the \"pixel\" variable is accessing methods, by way of the dot operator, from some image-manipulation class (set and get, etc.). That, I thought, would require the instantiation of an object. I guess Javascript does not require this.","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-07-31 12:41:07","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53d95813bf614b344b000033","None","[]","53da3963c066210c59000010","",""

So what I did basically is, I created a new image of <zipRedac>0<zipRedac> x <zipRedac>0<zipRedac> pixels and generated prime numbers from <zipRedac> to the number of pixels in the image(square of <zipRedac>0<zipRedac>). Then I started looping through this image starting from the center of the image in a square spiral manner(*as shown in Figure <zipRedac>*) and if the current position was a prime number, I did a `putpixel((x, y), color)` to mark that pixel(*as shown in Figure 2*). The hardest part was to get the `for` loop working, but I eventually got it. By the way, my next goal is to loop in a logarithmic spiral.

The Code used is very simple...

image = new SimpleImage(\"myimage.jpg\");
back = new SimpleImage(\"Dragon1.jpg\");
// The name of the image above varies with every different image.
back.setSameSize(image);

for (pixel: image) {
  avg = (pixel.getRed() + pixel.getGreen() + pixel.getBlue())/<zipRedac>;
  // your code here
  if (pixel.getRed() > avg * 1.5) {
  x = pixel.getX();
  y = pixel.getY();
  pixel2 = back.getPixel(x, y);
   
  pixel.setRed(pixel2.getRed());
  pixel.setGreen(pixel2.getGreen());
  pixel.setBlue(pixel2.getBlue());
  }
}
print(image);

**Question-1**: \"fence-ivy.jpg\" image
----------


----------


In this Exercise all you have to do is:

**Step 1**: Loop through the image.  

        for (pixel: image)


----------
**Step 2**: Compute the average.

        avg = (pixel.getRed() + pixel.getGreen() + pixel.getBlue()) / 3


----------


**Step 3**: Check if the green value of a pixel is higher than the average times 1.

        if (pixel.getGreen() > avg * 1.0)


----------


**Step 4**: If the value is higher, set the green value of that pixel to zero.

        pixel.setGreen(0);


----------

**Step 5:** Finally print the image.

        print (image);


----------
Putting everything together your code should look like:

        image = new SimpleImage(\"fence-ivy.jpg\");
    
        for (pixel: image) {
          avg = (pixel.getRed() + pixel.getGreen() + pixel.getBlue())/3
      
          if (pixel.getGreen() > avg * 1.0) {
          pixel.setGreen(0)
          }  
        }
    
        print(image);




----------


----------
**Question-2**: \"stop.jpg\" image
----------


----------


In this Exercise you have to do the following:

**Step 1** : Loop through the image as always.

        for (pixel: image)


----------
**Step 2**: Compute the average of the color bands of a pixel.

        avg = (pixel.getRed() + pixel.getGreen() + pixel.getBlue())/3

----------
**Step 3**: Check if the blue value of that pixel is higher than the average times 1.1:

        if (pixel.getBlue() > avg * 1.1)


----------
**Step 4**: If it is higher, then set the Red, Green and Blue values of that pixel to 20.

          pixel.setRed(20)
          pixel.setGreen(20)
          pixel.setBlue(20)


----------
**Step 5**: Finally print the image.

        print (image);


----------
Putting everything together your code should look like:

        image = new SimpleImage(\"stop.jpg\");
    
        for (pixel: image) {
          avg = (pixel.getRed() + pixel.getGreen() + pixel.getBlue())/3
      
          if (pixel.getBlue() > avg * 1.1) {
          pixel.setRed(20)
          pixel.setGreen(20)
          pixel.setBlue(20)
          }
        }

        print (image);

I tried to simplify my code. In my opinion, pixel from both pictures should be correspond to each other automatically. But it occurs that we should manually make that happen. 
For example, when I delete the following codes, the picture went like this.

  

      x=pixel.getX();
      y=pixel.getY();
      pixel2=back.getPixel(x,y);

Can anyone explain to me whether my assumption is true?

Also, how are \"X\"\"x\"defined? I tried to change the\"x\"to\"X\",\"y\"to\"Y\",\"X\"to\"x\",\"Y\"to\"y\", but it wouldn't work.

I can see you are on the right tracks with your code. I am a beginner too and hope you don't mind if I offer two suggestions that you might try....

I tried that already, but it didn't work. This is my code: 

for (pixel: image) {
 // 

1. as Heena pointed out, these two lines // need removing first...otherwise you have just entered your own 'comment' here before issuing a command to run your code.

Once you have removed your // lines (where you insert comments) the code you have will look like this instead: 


for (pixel: image) {


      avg=(pixel.getRed()+pixel.getGreen()+pixel.getBlue())/3; 
      if (pixel.getRed() > avg 1.2) { 
         pixel.setRed(avg*.5); 
         pixel.setGreen(avg*.5); 
         pixel.setBlue(avg*1.2); 

      } 

}

print(image);


Then, 

The second suggestion ...  As katie mcm points out...

Set these pixels at the values the question states. Lower the red and green values to half of the average (avg * 0.5) and raise the blue values to 1.2 of the average (avg * 1.2).


So, if, after you have removed your // lines you find that your  code is still not working the way you would like it to take another look at what Katie mcm above has written... 

In other words I think you may find for the red value and green value:


       pixel.setRed(avg*.5); 
       pixel.setGreen(avg*.5); 


you may need to use the 'divide' (/) by 2 sign rather than 'multiply' (*) by 0.5 sign.


I hope I have managed to be of some help and by adding to katiemcm, Helen and Heena comments you now get the gist and can see where, after just a couple of tweaks to your code, it should help get the result you seek.

That said, I have enrolled on the edX introduction to Linux course which starts today ( I think?  Don't quote me on that haha - I won't get chance to have a look until Sunday)  

I had to make a choice between a laptop and a tablet (on credit) and chose the latter so as only have a tablet I won't be able to get into downloading and setting up the system (?) like most computer courses require but... I am still going to listen to the lecturer discuss Linux for about six weeks just so I can get an understanding of what exactly Linux is.  

I hope it is taught like this as I seem to follow what this Professor is saying and am grateful he set this course up to let me learn a it of code as we learn about computing. I tried to start learning HTML and Python via Codecademy a website recommended to my from a fellow student when I signed up to AstroTech on the Coursera website and did the first basic introduction section okay and got to 4% completion and then when I moved onto the next stage the ruddy thing would not let me enter any lines using a tablet and I checked the foruma dn found people with tablets have been experiencing problems learning on the site so I lost interest and deleted the account so I am glad I can learn a little bit of code on this course.

Anyway, looking forward to learning a bit about Linux and hope it's just as interesting as this course.","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-08-01 20:51:32","{u'count': 1, u'point': 1, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [u'524659'], u'down': [], u'up_count': 1}",1,0,1,"['524659']","[]","53dbdd180a7aae3b3e00001f","None","[]","53dbfdd40a7aae3b3e000026","",""

It's a shame I couldn't remain on the course. I watched the first three lectures and if I had a laptop I would have also done that course alongside this one as well. I only have a tablet and the first part was using scratch code from some MIT site with exercise tasks followed using adobe for some reason which is not available on iPad.  I hoped I could skip that and resume from the second week but I found again it was like IIT Bombay and needed students to download stuff to a PC/laptop to do code and so they monitor work etc.  For all it's flashiness I don't think it's set up as good as this course.  I am glad I stumbled upon this course.  For me I feel this one has had more thought put into the course when it comes to it being made more accessible to students realising those who are interested/curious about computing may only have access to tablets or smartphones on which to learn.

There is an introduction to Linux course too for people with laptops/pc's that started today (I think) by edX.  Even though I won't be able to do the practical work I have still signed up to the course just to listen to lectures and see if I can actually learn about what Linux is lol. 

Anyway, hope you are enjoying CS50X (I think that professor worked at Google too like this Professor) and good luck with the rest of this course too.","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-08-01 21:36:46","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53da94edc066211b41000025","None","[]","53dc086e0a7aae3b3e00002b","",""

 1. Download [Komodo Edit][1] for your operating system and Install it.
 2. Open up the Komodo Edit.
 3. Open a new file and save it as \"first.html\" on the Desktop.
 4. Open the saved file from the Desktop with Firefox(Javascript works best on Firefox) by using the right click(a blank web page will appear).
 5. Now type the following into your saved file(\"first.html\").

        <html>
            <script type=\"text/javascript\">
                for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
                    document.write(\"Hello World\" + \"<br>\")
                }
            </script>
        </html>  
    (**Note**: `document.write(\"Hello World\")` is the same as `print (\"Hello World\")`);

 6. Now save the file and reload the blank web page. You should see \"Hello World\" 10 times.

----------


Code Explained:

 1. First we tell the web browser that this is an html file by typing `<html>`.
 2. Now to write the Javascript code we specify that it is a Javascript code. To do that we type `<script type=\"text/javascript\">`.
 3. Now we start writing our Javascript code.
 4. `for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++)` means loop through the instruction(s) for exactly 10 times. So first we set `i = 1`, then we say loop through the instruction(s) until `i <= 10` and finally we increment the value of i(`i++`). So it will increment the value of i each time the instructions are executed.
 5. `document.write(\"Hello World\" + \"<br>\")` means print \"Hello World\" and break the line `<br>`.`<br>` is an html code and it breaks the line.
 6. Finally we end our script `</script>` and the html `</html>` document.

I played around with the code from that example and I noticed that if you take out all the coding and reload the page, that not including the line pixel2 = back.getPixel(x,y); will cause an error saying that pixel2 is not defined. So, the reason that the photo changed the green pixels into that grey color is because pixel2 was still somewhat saved into the coding.

What that line does is assign pixel2 as the background pixels, which is needed when pixel2 is referred to in the later commands, so it has to be there.","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-08-02 06:48:45","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53db805d0a7aae3b3e00000c","None","[]","53dc89cd72bdaf8f92000002","",""

So when you type **x = pixel.getX()** you are really assigning the value returned by **getX()** to the variable you created called **x**.

This is exactly what you are commanding the computer to do:

 1. Let there be **x**

 2. Go forth and use the **getX()** method to find the horizontal position of a pixel

 3. Now thou shalt assign the value returned by **getX()** to **x**

So if you have a compiled file called **INSTALL** and you type **./INSTALL** it will run that file inside the current directory.

But if you just type **INSTALL** it should still work, however if there is another INSTALL file higher up in the hierarchy of paths, then there is some potential to execute that one instead, which is why sometimes people specify **./**  but it's not essential.  You just need the file to be genuinely compiled machine code and to have the executable bit in the file permissions set to True.

Windows works differently because Windows wants to ensure that you are aware of a file being executable by its extension, so if it is .**com** or **.exe** then this is a **binary executable** (compiled machine code).  If it ends in **.bat** or **.js** or **.py** (for example) then it is a script file and may or may not execute depending on the settings in your system.

The key difference is that you can examine the contents of a script file in a human-readable format before it runs, which you can't do with a binary executable file, so they are in theory safer to run that **.exe** files.

In Linux the equivalent of the **.bat** extension is **.sh**, but really any file can be made to run under **sh** if it contains a valid shell script, regardless of the extension.","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-08-02 07:28:13","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53daf22e980116833e000001","None","[]","53dc930d11c272adec000007","",""

Well, I'm going to show you exactly how to do it on your Windows machine.  

**Installation and Setup:**
-----------------------


----------


If you are on a Windows machine, you will have to download and install [python 2.7.8 (32-bit)][1] or [python 2.7.8 (64-bit)][2] depending on your system, but if you are on a Mac or Linux machine, python comes pre-installed. Since I use Linux, its pre-installed for me.  

After the installation is finished, set the path. To do this click on \"Start Menu\" and type in \"cmd.exe\" and click on \"cmd\". Now type the following command into your command prompt and hit enter.

        set path=%path%;C:Python27

Now you need to set the Environment Variable PATH, so that you can directly type `python` in the command prompt to use the interpreter from the command line without having to navigate to the main directory. Click on \"Start Menu\" and type in \"powershell\" and click on \"Windows Powershell\", that will open up the `powershell`. Wait until you see something similar to the command prompt. Now copy and paste the following command and hit enter.

        [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(\"Path\", \"$env:Path;C:Python27;C:Python27Scripts\", \"User\")

Just one last thing before we get started. You will need to install pip to easily install the Image module or any other additional modules. To install pip, right click on [get-pip.py][3] and click on \"Save Link As...\" and save it on your Desktop as \"get-pip.py\"(without quotation marks). Open up your command prompt(\"cmd\") as before. Now type the following commands one by one into your command prompt and hit enter.
    

        cd Desktop
        python get-pip.py

This script will install pip. After pip is installed, you can delete the get-pip.py script from the Desktop. We are almost there. Now lets install the Image module which we need to work with images. Open up the command prompt again and type the following command and hit enter.

        pip install Image

This will automatically download and install the Image module. To check if the Image module is installed properly, open up your command prompt, type `python` and hit enter. Now type `from PIL import Image` and hit enter, if you get no error, its installed successfully. Yay! You made it. Now lets get going!

**Let's get Started:**

    back.setSameSize(image);

![enter image description here][1]

For this one, I didn't need to edit it, for it was just how I wanted it.

![enter image description here][2]

However for this one, I did need to edit it. Originally, this Spock pic had also the image of the Enterprise. Since I wanted only Spock to be in the same place that Leo was in, I had to blue out everything else but Spock. I also had to make the image a bit longer and bigger than the Caprio picture too because I wanted to cover up Caprio's fist and because I didn't want Spock to cover up most of Leo de Caprio's face.

To create final result:

![Leo Bites Spock][3]

**Never use logic on Leo de Caprio...cuz he can get a little overboard.**

*The code to create this was as follows:*

`image = new SimpleImage(\"spockshock.jpg\"); back = new SimpleImage(\"leodecaprioscreaming.jpg\"); back.setSameSize(image);`

`for (pixel: image) {
avg = (pixel.getRed() + pixel.getGreen() + pixel.getBlue())/3;`

`if (pixel.getBlue() > avg*0.97) {
x = pixel.getX();
y = pixel.getY();
pixel2 = back.getPixel(pixel.getX(),pixel.getY());
pixel.setRed(pixel2.getRed());
pixel.setGreen(pixel2.getGreen());
pixel.setBlue(pixel2.getBlue());
`

}

}

print(image);

**Additional knowledge:**  

For IPv<zipRedac> address, the limit is <zipRedac>5535 (decimal representation), but IPv<zipRedac> uses hexadecimal representation and hexadecimal representation for <zipRedac>5535 is ffff.  

![enter image description here][2]

By the way the Internet is FULL. What I mean by that is since, we are all using IPv4 version and there are so many machines attached to the internet, that there is no way they all can have their own unique IP address. The maximum number of unique IP address we can have using IPv4 version is 2^32 which equals to 4,294,9<zipRedac>7,29<zipRedac>. And they are all taken, which means there are no more unique IP addresses left to assign. On February 3rd 20<zipRedac><zipRedac>, the authority ([IANA][3]) that hands out IP address, handed out the last number. So, there are no more addresses left. So, boohoo lol. We are all soon going to have to switch to IPv<zipRedac> version. The maximum number of IP addresses we could have using IPv<zipRedac> version is 2^<zipRedac>28 which equals to 340,282,3<zipRedac><zipRedac>,920,938,4<zipRedac>3,4<zipRedac>3,374,<zipRedac>07,43<zipRedac>,7<zipRedac>8,2<zipRedac><zipRedac>,45<zipRedac>. Yeah! That's right, even if each person had millions upon millions of devices, we wouldn't run out of IP address for a very long time. So yeah, we need to switch to IPv<zipRedac> version.

Okay fractions is not my strongpoint either!

As we know 1000 MB is equal to 1 GB (gigabytes) 

we can double this to show that 2GB would equal 2000 MB

But a full hour of recording is not occurring so we then keep hold of the math and start to break it down into fractions...


So, 2000 MB is equal to 2 GB (gigabytes)

There are 60 minutes in 1 hour

15 minutes equates to 1/4 of an hour.

2000 / 4 = total number of MB used.


There are 2 GB video being recorded in any given hour.

Only 15 minutes is being recorded.

2000 MB divided by 60 minutes gives the total number of MB per minutes and to deduce the total number of MB video recording usage we then multiply this by 15

Megabytes in 2GB  / Number of minutes in 1 hour * recording time (15 min)

2000 / 60 * 15 = total number of MB used.

Hope that helps.

Maybe someone is able to explain this better for Lexy.

I just wanted to thank Nick and Stanford for making this course available to us online.
I work quite closely with the IT department in my company, and every time I feel ashamed of how little I know and how much drawing on a whiteboard has to happen for me to understand the most basic things! So thank you from the bottom of heart, in particular for Week 3's look at hardware. It really will help me a lot at work on Monday!

How does a computer store letters, words, numbers and characters in binary?(.txt)  

It simply associates each character from 'a' to 'z', 'A' to 'Z', '<zipRedac>' to '9', and '[]{};':\",./<>?`~!@#$%^&*()_+-=' to a 8-bit binary number. Look at the Figure below.  

![enter image description here][<zipRedac>]

----------

The same way all the other file extensions are stored depending on what kind of data it is.  

For example, there is \"first.txt\", \"second.jpg\", \"third.png\", \"fourth.mp4\", \"fifth.mkv\" and \"sixth.txt\" on a computer.  

The binary data inside \"first.txt\" is \"<zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac>\", inside \"second.jpg\" is \"<zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac>\", inside \"third.png\" is \"<zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac>\", inside \"fourth.mp4\" is \"<zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac>\", inside \"fifth.mkv\" is \"<zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac>\" and inside \"sixth.txt\" is \"<zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac>\".  

Now when these files were stored, the computer associated the data of these files to its binary representation according to the extension of the file. As you see there are two \".txt\" files. What computer does here is, it assigns the byte \"<zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac>\" to the filename \"first.txt\" and the byte \"<zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac>\" to \"sixth.txt\". Now when you double click on a file \"first.txt\" on your computer, it pulls out the data stored with that name.

So the idea is the same but this time I looped in a Archimedean Spiral(*Figure 1*) using some Trigonometry and instead of using Image module, I did something called a Postscript Rendering. So, instead of raster graphics, it uses vector graphics, which is just awesome for creating high quality data structures.   

![enter image description here][1]  

           Figure 1: Archimedean Spiral


----------

Okay, let's see what the function x and y will do in my code. Let's plot a graph of `(x(n), y(n)) = (cos(2 * pi * sqrt(n)) * sqrt(n), -sin(2 * pi * sqrt(n)) * sqrt(n))` for n = 0 to 10. This results in radians. So, if we were to do this on our scientific calculators, we would have to change the mode 'D' to 'R'('Degrees' to 'Radians'). 

![enter image description here][2]  

                                        Figure 2: Graph of the path.


----------


Hells Yeah! That's cool, I have exactly what I need using simple trigonometric functions. 


----------


 

For the first one, what I did is, for each number at a position I calculated its factors and drew a circle at that point depending on the how many factors that number has. For example, a number with 2 factors, would have a radius of 0.1 mm and a number with 8 factors, would have a radius of 6.<zipRedac> mm. So, the larger the dots, the higher the number of factors of a number at that position. Here, is the code and the postscript file. Its pretty dope!   

[**Update:** I have uploaded these files to my web server, if you want to download and have a closer look at these data structures. Used an old unused domain name for this, so don't judge me on that lol. Download all these files from [**here**][3]. You can view these files in PDF reader.]

There are **100,000 points** on both postscripts.

![enter image description here][<zipRedac>]

        Figure 3: Sack's Spiral describing a pattern of no. of factors of a number at that point.


----------
For the second postscript file, I have marked the prime numbers. As you can see there is a gap on the right side in the middle. It is because all the numbers on that line are squares.

I had a heck of a time with the supergirl image when the background was pale blue, because it couldn't tell the difference between pale blue and dark blue of her clothing. So I changed the background to green. But then, it was erasing the green but ALSO the yellow of the Superman logo. That's when I realized both green and yellow have green RGB values above the average. And I noticed green has only green above the average but the other two are below the average, so I made that tweak to the code so it found green but left the yellow alone. If I had realized this earlier, I probably could have skipped the part where I changed the background to green and just found a boolean expression to differentiate between pale blue and dark blue.

      if (pixel.getGreen() > avg*1.05 && pixel.getRed() < avg*1.05 && pixel.getBlue() < avg*1.05 ) {
    pixel2 = back.getPixel(pixel.getX(), pixel.getY());

I have a couple of questions on this topic. First, can the same compiler translate a given source code into more than one machine code? (suppose you want to create two versions of the same program, each one for a different CPU brand) Second, is the CPU involved at all when the interpreter runs a given source code? I may be wrong, but the idea I got from the lecture is that unlike the compiler, the interpreter can execute source code in present time without translating it for the CPU; so, I'm assuming that it (the interpreter) has some sort of arithmetic and logic capability within it.

I'd appreciate any feedback on this subject. Thanks.","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-08-05 14:35:58","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","None","None","None","None","",""

The goal is to start from the top moving in adjacent lines and calculating the sum of all possible combinations(routes) and finding the largest sum.

                                20 61 83 40 12 61


----------
This is my approach:

What I did to solve this problem, is instead of brute-forcing each possible combination, I started from the bottom, adding up the largest of two numbers to the previous iteration.

    #!/usr/bin/python
    
    a = [[20, 61, 83, 40, 12, 61],
         [78, 34, 19, 30, 84],
         [2, 12, 78, 23],
         [12, 34, 56],
         [34, 67],
         [45]]
    
    # try: and except: are exception handlers, what they do is, if there is an error 
    # while executing the try: section, it jumps directly to the except: section and 
    # executes the instructions given in there. I used it because at some points
    # in my code the indexes were getting out of range and when it happens, it 
    # throws an error and stops. Using try: and except:, the code execute even if
    # there is an error.
 
    try:
        for i, x in enumerate(a):
            count = 0
            for j, y in enumerate(x):
                prev_it = a[i + 1]
                if j == len(x) - 1:
                    pass
                elif y > x[j + 1]:
                    prev_it[count] += y
                else:
                    prev_it[count] += x[j + 1]
                count += 1
    except IndexError:
        pass
    
    print a


----------


And this is what it prints:

    [[20, 61, 83, 40, 12, 61], [139, 117, 102, 70, 145], [141, 129, 180, 168], [153, 214, 236], [248, 303], [348]]

The answer is 348.

It's the first exercise of the Image Log Exercises, where you are supposed to remove the <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from the ivy in the photo?  Well what I end up doing is removing the <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from the entire photo so my image turns a purple color, instead of just the ivy.  Here is the code I came up with:

image = new SimpleImage(\"fence-ivy.jpg\");
 
for (pixel: image) {
  avg = (pixel.getRed() * pixel.getGreen() * pixel.getBlue())/3;
  if (pixel.getGreen() > avg * .0) {
  pixel.setGreen(0);
}
}
 
print(image)

Could someone tell me what I'm doing wrong?

A computer can run multiple programs at the same time, keeping their use of memory, drawing in windows etc. separated....

That's how the professor has described it in his notes and they then go on to verify what you have understood to be correct...

The CPU runs instructions using a \"fetch-execute\" cycle: the CPU gets the first instruction in the sequence, executes it (adding two numbers or whatever), then fetches the next instruction and executes it, and so on. Some of the instructions affect the order that the CPU takes through the instruction sequence .. for example an instruction might direct the CPU to jump back to an earlier point in the instruction sequence (loops are implemented this way), or to skip over the next instruction if a particular condition is true (if-statements are implemented this way).

How far along did you get with the Java course?

I am about to start that Java course in Udacity as it's available via iPad app.  Is it really rubbish?

I don't know if you have heard of a site called Udemy?  Here is the link with details of a number of Java courses available.  There is a mixture of courses available (but not all of them are FREE):

https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?q=java+programming


There is one course called Java for Complete beginners which is free.  Classes can be viewed via main website or via the Udemy app but you will need to download and install to computer JDK/JRE and another programme called Eclipse which the lecturer discusses with students at the very start of the course. I can't elaborate on this as I am unable to download them to my iPad and don't have a laptop so can't learn these courses but if you are using a computer and can download you should be fine.

Don't tell me the Udacity Java courses necessitates this too! I thought because it was available on the app you could learn the fundamentals within the course just like you can on this CS101 course.

I am a bit limited where I can learn programming languages using a tablet as most courses require downloading additional programmes to run on a computer in order to learn the programming languages.

I started Python and HTML/CSS in Codecademy completed 4% (the basic intro lessons) and was enjoying learning there but I have had to quit as Its temperamental around tablet usage and too often can't enter code on the learning pages so you spend ages trying to get the actual site working on the tablet and so for people only using iPads and tablets it's more trouble than it is worth.","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-08-05 21:13:29","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53de8f0154a10c4a6200001a","None","[]","53e148f9a5c46786f9000034","",""

There is also intro to Java on the MIT open courseware site.  I don't think there is a certificate for this course but what MIT does is uploads the courses run for students attending MIT so you get a chance to have a go at studying a taught module and it just so happens there is one for Java. And an intro to computing with Python that can be accessed at any time and if you are using a PC or laptop may be just what you want.  I have copied the link to website below:

You should save the pictures that you want to post to your hard drive (you can use **PrintScreen** or the **Save As** dialog, for example), then when you want to post a message with pictures, upload them using the \"image\" button (if you are using Windows you can press **Ctrl+G** as an easier way to access this menu), when the pop up window appears, click the **Choose file** button and select the pictures you want to add, finally click **OK**.

The image button is located just above when you are writing a post, this button is located next to the button showing <zipRedac>0<zipRedac>0<zipRedac>0.

----------


**What I do when someone's blocking my ping requests?**  

Well, there are many ways to find if the server is up. This is my way. I simply scan the whole machine. This is what hackers would do (homework), before attacking a server, but it is also used for so many other good reasons, for example, if you want to know what ports are open, closed or filtered on your computer, you can simply run this command. You could even scan all the local machines attached to the router and much more. You need a network mapper to do all this though.  

![enter image description here][1]


----------


**How to block incoming ping requests?**  

Assuming that you are using Windows, simply create a new custom Inbound rule, to block all ICMP protocols in Advanced Settings of your Windows Firewall. By the way, there is no specific port for ping because it is based on protocol.

To find your Internal IP address, just type in `ipconfig` into your command prompt and hit enter. You should look for a line that starts with IPv4, the number beside that is your Internal IP address.

    1996 9
    1996 12

means, the 9th month(September) and the 12th month(December) of the year 1996, both started from Sunday. If you look at the code, you will see that it prints the year and the month(not months) together, if a month started from Sunday. And the total number of months that started from Sunday in twentieth century is printed at the end(171).

**What is lexicographic order?**  

If you paid attention in your math classes you would know that(not trying to offend anyone), permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 021 is one possible permutation of the digits 0, 1 and 2. If all the permutations are listed numerically, that order is called a lexicographic order.

For example lexicographic order of digits 1, 2, 3  and 4 is:

    [1, 2, 3, 4]
    [1, 2, 4, 3]
    [1, 3, 2, 4]
    [1, 3, 4, 2]
    [1, 4, 2, 3]
    [1, 4, 3, 2]
    [2, 1, 3, 4]
    [2, 1, 4, 3]
    [2, 3, 1, 4]
    [2, 3, 4, 1]
    [2, 4, 1, 3]
    [2, 4, 3, 1]
    [3, 1, 2, 4]

Well, this one was a bit tricky, it took me couple hours to figure out how to create an algorithm that generates such an order, but I eventually figured it out and was able to create this algorithm. I hope you guys appreciate me sharing this:

Like an dingbat I've been ploughing through the material with Coursera! Anyway, I think I'm up to date now with Stanford.

Are you able to share the entire JavaScript code for the image manipulation exercises? I'd like to use it to give some insight to friends into how Photoshop and GIMP may manipulate images (Yes I know these programs are much more sophisticated and not written with JavaScript but its the insight I'm after).

When is IPv6 address used?
Also what does the following mean?

What is a tunnel adapter? And if you observe, this IPv6 address is different from the local link one! When is this one used?

@Hema91, I believe your code is fine, but the last two lines should be

I have copied it your code and pasted it into my exercise. I left it all in one bulk - no spacing or changes added apart from the following:

1. I deleted the space between the 'for (pixel: image)' and the curly bracket  '{' 

2. After the curly bracket mentioned above I hit return

I have done this three times now. On attempt one and three the script run without problems and the resulting image got accepted as a correct answer! However, on attempt number two there was an error with the line 5 syntax, e.g. for (pixel: image) {, and the two changes described above wouldn’t fix it. I have no idea why that is.
But I believe your code is correct.

Good luck

Just remember to remover the parenthesis () signs around the == (\"coke\") when using the == the parenthesis () are not needed.

They should also be removed from around the \"blue\" and \"red\"

It should work ok.

The question suggests to maybe also print out the list of names beginning with A and B to cross reference and check your code works okay.

It's to get you into the habit of double checking your work and code is giving you the results you seek.

I have run your code and yes, when I test the code and run it in the Survey Code Examples box it has worked perfectly fine providing the same results I have.

I think you are right when it comes to submitting the code for marking.  It probably does need to be the exact phrase in the print line(s) to be deemed correct and that is possibly why at the end of the Question it indicates:

As evitsa has suggested ....

You can add in an additional code 

    print(row);

beneath each of the count variables:

count1 = count1 + 1;

count2 = count2 + 1;
   

I think this is optional but as suggested in the question:


\"You can always print out rows and count them by hand to check your code\"

So, by adding this line, it enables you to display the number of lines the count has added up and shown in the return result.

In turn, this will enable you to cross check that the count code is working correctly 

(i.e:- the total number of rows counted is correct as the number displayed should also match the number of rows that are shown/listed)

count1 = count1 + 1;

       print(row);

count2 = count2 + 1;

       print(row);

Okay, i am not sure which question you are attempting so I have copied and pasted your code and run it in the box within the SURVEY CODE EXAMPLE PROBLEMS section.

Meet Jack.  Jack is an active person whose busy lifestyle often includes regular visits to the gym or to the swimming baths or the running track/sports arena.

Each day Jack gets up, gets dressed and wears a variety of everyday clothes.

On the days Jack visits the gym/swimming pool, running track and/or sports arena he takes a bag containing a change of clothes with him so he can can change out of his everyday clothes and change into clothing better suited to the type of activity he is about to undertake.

Jack finds somewhere to store his everyday clothes so he doesn't have to leave them unattended or take him with him whilst he is participating in his routine activities.

Just around the corner he sees there are a number of lockers where other people are storing their everyday clothes whilst they too exercise.  

Jack locates an (empty'locker') which has been labelled number #1 (Jack is now aware his locker = number #1 so able to remember exactly where he has placed his everyday clothes) and when he returns form his exercise/fitness activities can quickly locate the locker he has been using and change back into his everyday clothes.




Now...

Think of the 'variable' as being something like a 'locker' 

This locker can be accessed by many people and store lots of different items.

Think of the 'variable name' as being the 'locker number'

This makes locating the locker easier to find especially if there are lots of lockers located in the same area

Think of the () parenthesis as being the space 'inside' the locker where (everyday clothes /personal belongings etc stored within the locker)

locker = number #1(\"Jacks everyday clothes\");

This is where, hopefully, you will begin to see the purpose of the code being written in the if statements...","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-08-10 13:11:54","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53e7239a2665bca04700002c","53e755cf584d966cc4000009","[ObjectId('53e755cf584d966cc4000009')]","53e755cf584d966cc4000009-53e76f9a584d96f85e000008","",""

Can you see the slight error that has been made that results in no 'error message' appearing because the syntax is correctly written but...still results in nothing being displayed?

Going back to the code and the first statement

for (row: table) {

  print(rank); } 

This is because you have asked the code to have a look in the database list of baby names registered in 2012 and that part of the code is okay...

But..then the code has a slight glitch in the request as the code goes on to ask if...upon searching the 'field' labelled \"name\" in the baby-2010 Table it comes across NAMES that begin with the letters \"rank\" ... Proceed in executing my instruction and print out a list of those NAMES but remember... I only want you to print out the names that begin with the letters \"RANK\"

So, although what has been written in the code reads okay and will operate when executed the instruction will end up with an output that may result in NO names being FOUND in the baby-2010 database 

So to get the names of the babies from the instruction ...

startsWith.(\"rank\")

This code need to be tweaked a little...

And the Professor provides a good example of the how the code could be written instead....

have a look again at the code you have written and see which part (or parts) of could be tweaked to get better output results....


table = new SimpleTable(\"baby-2010.csv\"); 

for (row: table) { 

     if (row.getField(\"name\").startsWith(\"rank\")) {

         print(year); }


     if (row.getField(\"name\").startsWith(\"gender\")) { 
         print(gender); }

Just remember that \"gender\" \"rank\" and \"name\" are 'fields' 

and are most likely to to be entered into the first part of the 'if' code 

Eg:

      if (row.getField(\"name\").startsWith(\"A\")) { 
      print(row); }

      if (row.getField(\"name\").endsWith(\"y\")) { 
      print(row); }


      if (row.getField(\"gender\") == \"girl\" ){ 
      print(row); }


      if (row.getField(\"rank\") <=10 { 
      print(row); }


Try running one if statement at a time to make sure they work correctly.


If you still have difficulty post your code again so someone can check it.

Hope this has helped clarify things for you.

In the Week 4 lecture \"The Internet-TCP/IP\" it is stated that the IP address given by Sandra Bullock is a blunder in that it represents an address that is not possible according to the rules for IP addresses.  I submit that it is quite possible that the address was knowingly given as incorrect, in much the same way that telephone numbers are given in movies as say, \"<phoneRedac>\", using a number that is patently invalid, to avoid the situation where people actually call the number. (cf. the 1982 one hit wonder by Tommy Tutone: \"<phoneRedac>/Jenny\")  I think the same situation might be valid for IP addresses.

Consequently, the IP address is technically not a blunder.","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-08-10 17:50:15","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","None","None","None","None","",""

There are plenty of VERY important and helpful improvements that could be made to almost all of the classes thus far based on the extensive feedback of many of its users. But they haven't.

Looks like they even have basic errors that some users have made known --> https://class.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/CS101/Summer2014/wiki/Engineering.CS101.Summer2014/errata/

If they still have basic errors that they aren't fixing, I'm highly doubtful any important updates on the content have been made.

I'm having trouble with the Golden Gate Bridge exercise. I type in this code:
image = new SimpleImage(\"golden-gate-red.jpg\");

for (pixel: image) {

  avg = (pixel.getRed() + pixel.getGreen() + pixel.getBlue())/3;
  pixel.setRed(avg);
  pixel.setGreen(avg);
  pixel.setBlue(avg);

}

print(image);
I run it and it shows the Golden Gate gray. After submitting it the image to the right disappears and it marks it wrong. I searched and found another post about the same exercise and found someone who said this code worked:
image = new SimpleImage(\"golden-gate-red.jpg\");

for (pixel: image) {

avg = (pixel.getRed() + pixel.getGreen() + pixel.getBlue())/3; pixel.setRed(avg); pixel.setGreen(avg); pixel.setBlue(avg); }

print(image);

The exact same thing happened. I then copied and pasted the exact same code (minus Golden Gate image, of course) to the banana question and it marked it correct. Can anyone spot any errors or have any advice. Thanks!

You need to have && in your if statements because the question is asking for 2 things: 

1) the students who selected coke && red 

2) the students who selected coke && blue 

So, you should create 2 if statements that satisfy those conditions.  Also, you can use startsWith to find coke, but it would be better to use ==. I'm not sure if it the code would be accepted as correct using startsWith. So, at the end there should be two lines that you print: red count and blue count.

Hope this helps. :)","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-08-11 16:36:20","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53e8ea2fa6e28d42ca000015","None","[]","53e8f104429374c73700001c","",""

the syntax for an \"if\" statement is 
if (condition){

The formatting is not essential, but does help. Your problem is that you have placed your curly bracket before \"if (condition)\" instead of after. An \"if\" statement without curly brackets will only execute the next line.
Brackets are used to group code together.

My best advice is that if you have an idea for something, do it. Even if you don't know how. The internet is a great resource and there are many websites that explain pretty much every concept. Online courses can be a bit limited in material and supply. Unfortunately, the most convenient way to learn is to teach yourself. With that being said, I would highly recommend [Codecademy.com][1].
It is a great resource and a great way to learn JavaScript and jQuery as well other languages and tools.

It's very easy. First, you will need to install python. Refer to the Installation and Setup section of my [post][1] (Skip everything after you set the Environment Variable PATH, if you don't want the Image module).

So, to work with csv files, we need to import csv module, which is built-in and to do that we simply write `import csv` at the beginning of our python script.

I am going to solve all Exercises of \"Table Counting Multiple Exercises\" using python.


----------
## Table counting multiple Exercise-1 ##
*Do more baby names start with \"A\" or \"B\"? Write code to count and print those two counts (\"A\" count, then \"B\" count).*  

(Download the \"***baby-<zipRedac>010.csv***\", \"***survey-<zipRedac>010.csv***\" and all these ***exercises*** from my [repository][<zipRedac>]. To download the file on your computer, click on the file and you should see \"Raw\", click on it and press Ctrl + S, and save it on your Desktop. Make sure you have all these files in the same directory.)

(**Note**: Code is Explained below)

----------
## Table counting multiple Exercise-<zipRedac> ##

*Now we'll look at the survey data. How many people identified \"red\" or \"blue\" as their favorite color? The appropriate field in the survey is \"color\". Write code to count and print those two cases (\"red\" count, then \"blue\" count).* 

![enter image description here][4]


----------
## Table counting mutltiple Exercise-3 ##

*Instead of looking at the whole survey, let's look only at the people who identified \"coke\" as their favorite soda (not \"diet coke\", just \"coke\"). How many of them (\"coke\" rows) identified \"red\" or \"blue\" as their favorite color? The appropriate fields in the survey are \"soda\" and \"color\". Write code to count and print those two cases (\"red\" count, then \"blue\" count).*

Variables are the way the computer remembers certain attributes of a program. Basically, only using \"new SimpleImage (\"x.png\")\" will create an variable, do the task you tell it to(such as scale), and then forget everything you did. In other words, if you want the computer to remember something, you have to tell it to do so. That being said, lack of variables can be a good thing. Telling the computer to remember less causes it to use less RAM. If you just wanted to print the image (\"print(new SimpleImage (\"x.png\"))\"), this would work., but if you want to manipulate a variable at all, you must create a variable.","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-08-13 01:50:11","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53eabfc83a92cb06f5000034","None","[]","53eac4533a92cbcff900002b","",""

If you're just looking to complete the exercises, you don't actually have to do anything with the \"back.setSameSize(image);\" command in the \"Image Bluescreen Exercises\" to finish the questions.  Nick has already included this code in the example, and you only need to add code where he has written \"//your code here\".

If you're wondering more generally what it does and why you need it, read on.

We are working with two images in the bluescreen exercises.  For example, in Q1 there is the \"striped-fish-green.jpg\" image and the \"yosemite.jpg\" image.  Now, these two images *could be* different sizes in their original form.  For instance, \"striped-fish-green.jpg\" might be 800x600 pixels while \"yosemite.jpg\" might be 200x100 pixels.  The problem with this is that when you attempt to \"place\" the fish onto the Yosemite background picture, there may be pixels in the \"striped-fish-green.jpg\" image that do not have a corresponding pixel in the \"yosemite.jpg\" image.  For example, using my previous image sizes, there is one pixel in the fish image whose X and Y coordinates are (800,600).  However, there is no pixel in the Yosemite image whose X and Y coordinates are (800,600) because the image is only 200x100 pixels.

We get around this issue by using the \"back.setSameSize(image);\" command, which literally forces the two images to contain exactly the same number of pixels.  Notice how the first two lines of code are:

image = new SimpleImage(\"striped-fish-green.jpg\");

back = new SimpleImage(\"yosemite.jpg\");

The first line assigns the \"striped-fish-green.jpg\" image to the \"image\" variable, while the second assigns the \"yosemite.jpg\" image to the \"back\" variable. Therefore, when we write:

\"back.setSameSize(image);\"

the computer is re-sizing the \"back\" image so that it is the same size as the \"image\" image.  Or, if we ignore the assigned variable names, we're re-sizing the \"yosemite.jpg\" image so that it is the same size as the \"striped-fish-green.jpg\" image.

Hope that helps!","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-08-13 23:03:32","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53ebb39da3fbcb21cb000016","53ebe502d82a70ad13000019","[ObjectId('53ebe502d82a70ad13000019')]","53ebe502d82a70ad13000019-53ebeec4a3fbcbfc0a000029","",""

Download this [zip file][1] from my repository and images ([banana.jpg][<zipRedac>], [curb.jpg][3], [pebbles.jpg][4], [redwood.jpg][5]) to play around with my webpage. Make sure you save all the files including images in a same folder and save the images with the names that I have provided(e.g, banana.jpg) or else the code won't work. (Check back later, I'm adding more Table Counting Exercises.)

jQuery is a library for Javascript that does event handling, animation and stuff. CSS lets you change the background color, border, background image and stuff. HTML is like a skeleton of a webpage.

 Webpage Features:

 - Press the key \"m\" to navigate and \"Enter\" to toggle the code.
 - You can even click on the tab.
 - To run the code, click the \"Run\" button.
 - To reset the image, you will have to reload the page.

Everything that starts with \"$\" in the code is jQuery.

thanks for outstanding course.  i am an Econ Major (Lsju '65) and a lawyer who spent a career in the semiconductor industry.  i have two sons who are CS majors and GSB grads. One of them is a Stanford undergrad.  I have been around computers since college, i have  argued about them in court and introduced my boys to the TI 994A when they were toddlers. 

until this course, though, i fit your description of a user who thought of computers as \"opaque\" and maybe even a little unfriendly..certainly nothing i could control. Now i have the intellectual arrogance of a Freshman and will soon be advising my boys as to how to program their machines for greater efficiency. You have unleashed a fearsome force upon an unsuspecting world.

In addition, you made the course one hell of a lot of fun on the way.  This is what MOOC can do and i thank  you very much.

BTW, I have a 6 year old Grand daughter who had bi lateral Cochlear implants put in at the Stanford Hospital when she was 11 months old. She now sings and plays the violin. You are right; this technology  is truly a miracle for which we are profoundly thankful.","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-08-16 00:25:00","{u'count': 5, u'point': 5, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [u'442713', u'446349', u'544023', u'359446', u'507812'], u'down': [], u'up_count': 5}",5,0,5,"['442713', '446349', '544023', '359446', '507812']","[]","None","None","None","None","",""

so as payback to the community here and Professor Nick, here are some links and courses (all MOOCs that are free and from mostly well reputed universities and institutes).. i have to give credit first to the guys at [aGupieWare][1] 's blog for their hard work compiling a ist of free MOOCs that can essentially give you the same amount of knowledge and information that a CS university fresh graduate has.. 
enough talk then, let's start with the links:

[A Bachelor's Level Computer Science Program Curriculum (Updated)][2]

this is the original post on aGupieWare's blog with a list of Introductory courses, core courses and electives, I'd suggest you read through the whole post, take your time to read and understand the methodology then jump right in..
I'm close to finishing MIT's [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming][3] and i have to say that i'm enjoying it, professor Guttag is awesome, the course uses Python as a language which is easy to understand, all the problem sets, lecture notes and even recitations and quizzes are posted on the MIT OCW course page.

this is how far i got so i can't \"guide\" you further but in my humble opinion, that post and [the follow-up post][4]  can show you where to go next.

add some resources to interactively learn Python while going through the course like [Codecademy][5] and you should get pretty adequate and familiar with CS and programming soon enough depending on how much time you devote to learning this, i believe I've made some really good progress finishing this Course, MIT's course and Codecademy's Python course in the past couple of months while having to go through my full time job as an architect, social life and still having fun, might be hard but definitely possible.

Thanks again Professor, everyone .. it's been a pleasure.

Discalimer: I'm not in anyway affiliated or connected to aGupieWare, MIT or Codecademy .. it would've been an honor but had to clarify that.

it would be totally awesome if I could take spreadsheet data and do stuff like we did with the tables, eg if it were class marks, returning entries that were say females who got over 80% or whatever. 

Does anyone know if you can do that, and how? I'm hoping it would be easy, it would definitely be so useful for me to do that!

Thanks!

It's built-in into all the web browsers. I am creating a website that has the JavaScript code for all the exercises that we have done here. You can even run and reset the code. The website is pretty awesome, coz I have added some cool animation and the background is actually a video. I am also going to add the explanation for each code. I will post it here as soon as I am done with it. This is what I have done so far.

![enter image description here][1]

By the way, start from [codecademy][2] if you want to learn JavaScript, they cover all the basics.

You would actually have to learn basic HTML to use JavaScript and CSS if you want to add colors and effects. Well, I would suggest you start with Python. It's easy to learn, yet powerful. I started with Python and after that learned JavaScript and  I found it pretty easy. If you want to install and setup Python look at my [post][1], where I've explained how to install and setup Python. And check my [post][2] on JavaScript where I've explained how to start coding JavaScript.

These are basic things to do in Excel, http://bookboon.com/ has some intro courseware for Excel that might be of help (free).  Just remember that if all you know is a \"hammer\" then every problem becomes \"a nail\".  Some of what you are asking is very doable in spreadsheet, but it is actually a database function and is probably ultimately a Sql based solution on a larger scale.  Doing stats on 30 students is one thing, doing the same thing for all the students at a university is another.  There is so much more that Excel, but too many people get caught in the hammer/nail environment.  Expand you knowledge and you expand your horizons.

It shows an illustration of the data being sent with 1's represented as 3 volt charges and 0's represented as no charge.

My question is this: how does the receiving computer know when a transfer has begun or ended?  If a 0 is no charge, and there is no charge before and after a packet is sent, how can it know that there isn't one zero (or many) at the beginning or end?

My first thought was that the checksum would take care of this, but there were two possible issues with that:

  * I don't know if checksums are standard and included by default with each packet sent or if they are optional.


  * The checksum itself is represented by 0's and 1's sent in the same way.

1.Write code that picks out the pixels of the green leaves in the image (using the > avg * factor technique, as in lecture). For each green pixel identified, set its green value to 0. The result is that the green leaves are changed to a sort of weird purple color, since setting green to 0, we just have red and blue contributing. 
2.For the stop.jpg image, write code that picks out the blue sky (using the > avg * factor technique, as in lecture). Change the blue pixels to be red=20 green=20 blue=20 .. so it looks like nighttime. Adjust your code so it changes the sky, but not the white letters in the sign (which are technically a little blue). 
3.The goal for this problem is to change the curb to look blue. Detect the red pixels of the curb using the avg technique. For each pixel, change its red and green values to be half the average value, and change its blue value to 1.2 times the average value. In effect, this sets red and green low and blue high, making it look kind of blue. Note that the blue effect will apply to the reddish plants off to the right as well -- now they are blueish plants.
 Just left with that and I will be 100% complete too","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-08-20 06:42:34","{u'count': 0, u'point': 0, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [], u'down': [], u'up_count': 0}",0,0,0,"[]","[]","53f31d3439ccf28c70000001","53f3574839ccf2ff6f00000b","[ObjectId('53f3574839ccf2ff6f00000b')]","53f3574839ccf2ff6f00000b-53f4435a4906cad46e00000e","",""

Thank you for this wonderful introductory course into Computer Science. My trepidation towards computers- software and hardware has disappeared and I look forward to more advanced courses in the future.

Special thanks to Nick Parlante for taking the time and effort to create this MOOC for people like us who are interested but never found the right opportunity to learn about how computers work.  

Have a great day!

 1. I tried to open this website on Internet Explorer and Chrome and found that both of these browsers were unable to load one of the fonts, so I have added a link to the font and it works now.
 <zipRedac>. I have added a .zip file that already has all the files structured the way they are supposed to be, so, you don't have to download them one by one.

 <zipRedac>. I will add one more slide that will let you convert your own image to Grayscale like banana.jpg exercise and change a band value of the pixels of your image to your choice like curb.jpg exercise.)

I am finally done with this. So, here is what I have done:

 1. Solved six exercises using JavaScript, banana.jpg, curb.jpg, redwood.jpg, one baby-<zipRedac>010.csv and two survey-<zipRedac>010.csv exercises.
 <zipRedac>. Run and Reset buttons to run and reset the code(maximizes when you hover over these buttons).
 3. Right and Left arrow buttons to navigate the slides(maximizes when you hover over these buttons).
 <zipRedac>. Explanation for the code.

(**Note**: For last three exercises, I have wrote the JavaScript code to hide the code explanation when the run button is clicked and when the Reset button is clicked the table goes away and the code explanation is displayed. So, to look at the Code explanations for last three exercises, click Reset after you click Run.)

(**Note**: This website runs without any problem with Mozilla Firefox.)

**Visit the Website**: [Click here][1] to visit my website.

**Download the code**: If you want to look at the whole code, then download this [zip][<zipRedac>] file, unzip it and double click on javascript.html to fire up the website. To look at all the JavaScript(app.js) code go to the js folder and open up app.js with Notepad and to look at the html(javascript.html) code and css(style.css) code, right click on each files and open with Notepad.

Yes, it took couple days to put everything together and make it work. All the code(app.js, style.css, javascript.html) together counts up to 1354 lines.

I have uploaded those .js files on my github repository. Download them from [here][1]. There is a \"Download ZIP\" on the bottom right corner. Click on it and you will have those three .js files.

It doesn't really matter if you put them on a Desktop or anywhere on the computer, unless the file tree is structured the way I have described.

Glad that you like it!

And by the way, you could be good enough at programming if you want to. Start from [codecademy][2]. That's where I started programming couple months ago and now I know five different programming languages Python, JavaScript, jQuery(JavaScript's library), CSS and HTML.

I've encountered an issue with Q3 Exercises 23 Analog and Digital.
The question is:

Q3 (1 point possible)

Select any of the following which are examples of an analog system.

- Suppose we have two cans connected with string. Speak into one tin can. The can vibrates a string, which vibrates the can at the other end.

- On vinyl music records there are tiny up and down movements cut into the plastic to represent the up and down movements of the sound on the record.

- Visualize an 18th century pirate sailing ship. Visualize the big ship's wheel. The wheel is connected through a series of ropes and pulleys to the big vertical rudder at the back of the ship. Turning the wheel a little moves the rudder a little. Turning the wheel a lot moves the rudder a lot.

No matter what I select the answer is always wrong; that's the first time I've had such an issue. I don't want to know the answer to the question- I'm pretty sure I know that - but I'd like to know how to sort this issue out.

Embbeding security into your code design (on top of keeping application and OS in their latest version) can help you face the large majority of common attacks.

In order to get some awareness on this topic, I recommend you all to have a look at the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) website: [https://www.owasp.org/][1]; and if you have the chance, why not attend one of their meetings. The speakers invited are generally very interesting and knowledgeable.

On a personal level, it really opened my eyes.

I thought I had the blue curb image but the code is marked wrong. Getting the piont does not matter but I need to know where I went wrong:

image = new SimpleImage(\"curb.jpg\");

for (pixel: image) {

using (avg *0.5) for the red and green pixels doesn't help either. nor changing the if-statement to \"> avg *0.4\" or \"*0.45\".

Just wanted to stop by and say that this course provided a solid foundation for me that I have since built upon through some other programming and math courses, to the point where I am now juggling fairly complex Machine Learning concepts. I would have never thought that possible a year ago.

So thank you! What you do here is extremely important, providing an entrance to computing for people around the world who for whatever reasons are unable to pursue a traditional University degree.

Your question is not that simple - there's a bunch of related topics, including [modulation][1], [line coding][2], [bit stuffing][3] and so on. Basically, each frame begins with some special delimiting sequence of bits (called \"Preamble\" in Ethernet), so that's how computer separates different frames.

 1. Change your images to be GrayScale.
 2. Change your images' color(like we changed the curb color) to any color you would like.
 3. Do Bluescreening on your images.
 4. Working on more Image effects(Embossing, Edge detection, Invert the Image, Flip the Image, Blend two Images together, Change the opacity of the Image)

Visit my website [here][1].

Website coded using: HTML5, CSS, Javascript, PHP and Python.  
Website tested and works well on: Mozilla Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer.

Please read the instructions to use all the features of the website and the interface effectively.

 - I have added key events for right and left arrow keys, so to navigate the slides you could also use the right and left arrow keys.

## GrayScale ##

All you do here is:

 1. Select your Image.
 2. Upload it.
 3. Run to apply GrayScale effect to your image.
 4. Reset to load your original image.  

(Don't worry about your image sizes, I have added code that will keep downscaling your image untill its width is less than 600px and height is 400px. It will also maintain the aspect ratio of the original image.)

**Example:**

![enter image description here][3]

----------
## Change a pixel's color(RGB) to a different color(RGB) like the curb.jpg exercise ##

 1. Select the image.
 2. Upload it.
     - Here your image will be resized if it's size is more than 600px x 400px.
 3. Choose a target color. (For example, to use this effect on the curb image, you would choose 'red'.)
 4. Choose a color to replace the target color. (For example, to use this effect on the curb image, you would choose 'blue'.)
 5. Increment/Decrement the mask by.
     - Here I have added some key events. To use this select your increment/decrement value, click on the text box below and use the up and down arrow keys to increment and decrement the mask respectively. I have added 0.001 for more precision. Then if you want to Run the code hit 'Enter' and to Reset the code hit 'Esc'.
 6. Run and Reset Buttons.
     - You can also use the Run and Reset Buttons.

**Bug:** If you want to change the image, I suggest you reload the page. If you don't reload the page, the increments would not work as expected. I will fix this soon.(Applies to the bluescreen effect as well)

**Example:**

        I just wanted to thank you for taking the time to make this course. I had so much fun not only taking the course but watching you teach it! you are such a phenomenal teacher and I can not wait to see if you make a CS102, I would definitely take right away. I hope to come over to Stanford and, fingers crossed, get to meet you and take your courses. I have a strong interest in Computer Sciences and I learn more about it every day (especially through these classes). You are one of the best teachers I have ever had, and I can not wait to hear more from you

I think many people deal with computers with a little bit of fear and hesitation. My plan has been that CS101 gives you insight into the logical, mechanical way that computers work. My hope is that, with that background, you have the confidence and patience to make computers work for you in the future -- something as simple as a spreadsheet, or for some of you, perhaps a full programming course.

There's a possibility that I will create a more advanced \"CS102\" course on Stanford Online to follow CS101. If that happens, I will certainly send out an email announcement to all the CS101 students.
Statement of Accomplishment: you should have all your work done by Aug 28th (actually Aug 30th is good enough), before we create the SOAs. You can go to your Stanford Online dashboard page to check the spelling of your name before we generate the SOAs. The SOAs should be complete by Sept 5 or sooner; we'll send an announcement when they are ready.
It's been a pleasure teaching this course, and I especially enjoy the various friendly emails and forum comments I've gotten from students of all descriptions.
Thanks for al the kind comments, and best wishes for the future and the many computers in it!
Cheers,
Nick Parlante","Engineering/CS101/Summer2014","2014-08-28 23:11:21","{u'count': 5, u'point': 5, u'down_count': 0, u'up': [u'458707', u'460511', u'218655', u'501937', u'446698'], u'down': [], u'up_count': 5}",5,0,5,"['458707', '460511', '218655', '501937', '446698']","[]","53ffa4674999a0a44000000f","None","[]","53ffb719b15de25898000016","",""

In regards to finishing by the 30th, I'm on the same boat! I was stuck on this as well, but was able to find the solution.

So when you get to the part of setting RGB and it's asking for half the average of red, it'll look something like this:

pixel.setRed(avg/2);

and so on. I don't want to give too much away, but that should give you an <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>.

Thank you so much for your efforts and hard work, i never thought that i could ever learned all these stuff so easily the way you present everything in CS101. After completing CS101 i am feeling much more confident about so many topics and now i can say to myself that yes i know lots of things about computers and can also do some experiments with the languages too like Bluescreen and all.

Thanks a lot

Its Week 5, Table Counting (Multiple) Exercises #3.

The directions state that I have to count how many people select coke as their favorite drink, AND blue as their favorite color. And then how many people (who still chose coke as their fav drink) selected red as their fav color. This is my code:

table = new SimpleTable(\"survey-2012.csv\");

table.convertToLowerCase();

count1 = 0;

count2 = 0;

for (row: table) {

   if(row.getField(\"soda\")==\"coke\")&&

   (row.getField(\"color\")==\"red\"){

   print(row);

   count1=count1+1;

   }
   
   if(row.getField(\"soda\") == \"coke\")&&

   (row.getField(\"color\")== \"blue\"){

   print(row);

   count2=count2 + 1;

   }
   }
   
   
  print(\"red count:\",count)

  print(\"blue count:\",count)


But whenever i run it is says \"Unexpected token: &&\"

But I  have to use \"&&\"!! For \"And\"

Second, I just saw that MIT is offering its intro computer programming class on edX in a similar format to this class. A few weeks ago , I began watching the lectures and working through the problems sets of the in-person course, archived on MIT's website, but this format seems like a much better fit for online learners without much of a math background (I was a lowly Communication Studies major haha). Anyway, check it out. It is a great natural progression from this class if you are interested in programming: https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-6-00-1x-introduction-computer-2841#.VADmFcVdW_g

Image Logic Exercises Q1. 
       \"weird purple color\" was big issue for me. We already know when we mix Red and Blue    it will be purple color. But don't get what was the value, however I realize we have the \"avg\". 

Image Logic Exercises Q3. 
        Same as here.  We have the magic number \"avg\".

Image Bluescreen Exercises Q2. 
        If you ask me more specific, it could be easy to answer, but I am not sure what you are asking. Anyway, based on my mistake, the question ask replacing the trunk which is RED. 
I have changed leaves and I didn't understood what was wrong.
